          <p><span class="dark-highlight">S</span>ince the mid-1930s, our great grandparents, Nick and Clara Pezzente spent their summer vacations with family and friends along the Connecticut shoreline. They looked forward to leaving the hustle and bustle of Hartford for the slow and easy lifestyle on one of the many beaches.</p>

          <p><span class="dark-highlight">I</span> will always remember them reminiscing the good times they enjoyed and shared with others. </p>

          <p><span class="dark-highlight">W</span>hether it was sunbathing, gathering together for a cookout, clam bake, fishing, or taking a refreshing swim in the cool waters of the Long Island sound. For them, life on the shoreline was at its best! No visit to the shoreline would be complete without sampling the fare from the local dining hotspots. They especially looked forward to the fresh seafood.</p>
 
          <p><span class="dark-highlight">I</span>n the 1940s, Nick and Clara discovered Old Saybrook, located at the mouth of the Connecticut River along the shoreline of the Long Island Sound. They began renting waterfront cottages in Cornfield Point every summer. My great grandfather would tell me, “Old Saybrook is the best town on the shoreline.” and they would talk about how much they wanted to own a cottage on the water.</p>

          <p><span class="dark-highlight">I</span>n 1949, a property went up for sale three doors down from where they were renting. An offer was made and the papers were signed. Nick and Clara realized their dream of owning a waterfront cottage. Shortly after their purchase, while my great grandfather was working in the yard, a man from New York drove up and asked him if he owned the place.</p>

          <p><span class="dark-highlight">H</span>e wanted to rent the cottage for the entire summer season along with the small cottage for his waitstaff. They agreed and the cottages have been rented ever since.</p>

            <p>Now 65 years and four generations later, we continue to manage these two waterfront cottages as a small reminder of the nostalgic past, living along the New England shoreline. From the turn of the century iron bedframes, and fumed Oak furniture, to the more contemporary comforts, you too will discover what my great grandparents discovered over 65 years ago… life along the shoreline is at its best!</p>
